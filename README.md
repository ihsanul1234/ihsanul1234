- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ihsanul Haq.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning B-tech computer science & Engineering and i am in 5th semester.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m now interested to study c prgramming language, continuing my study with help of a text book named "<b>programming in ANSI-C</b>" by the author <i>E Balaguruswamy</i>.
- I started reading it,After first few chapters i can say it is actually a good book,readers understands the concepts though author used simple words to write it.
- I also like HTML,java,c++,kotlin etc.And I'am looking forward to learn those in future time.
-  I'm practicing to type fast,And there is a cool website out there - <a href="www.keybr.com">www.keybr.com</a>.
