- 👋 Hi, I’m Ihsanul Haq.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning BCA .
- 👀 I’m now interested to study c prgramming language, continuing my study with help of a text book named "<b>programming in ANSI-C</b>" by the author <i>E Balaguruswamy</i>.
- I started reading it,After first few chapters i can say it is actually a good book,readers understands the concepts though author used simple words to write it.
- I also like HTML,java,c++,kotlin etc.And I'am looking forward to learn those in future time.
-  I'm practicing to type fast,And there is a cool website out there - <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">www.keybr.com</a>.
